# HTTP5101_FinalAssignment

Hi Christine,

I would like to apologize for the state of this file. 
I am fully aware that the code is not working, but I did it to the best of my abilities.
I have left various comments in the code. 
I'm going to honestly say that there was a lot in this course that I did not fully understand.
I understand that this course is important, that C# and any and all backend development is difficult.
Thank you for taking the time to help me with my coding issues. I will continue to work on this even after this course's completion.
I hope to be able to figure it out on my own, and if not, perhaps I can ask for your help in the future as well?

Thank you again,

Rose Zhan
